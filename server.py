this is the navigating robot server
the prototype code will execute on a server
the navbot will communicate by internet sockets
literally, this is envisioned as WiFi, but can be
light or sound signalling.


simplifying design rules:
  The navbot prototype is coded in Arduino C
  The navbot prototype has a movement module
  The navbot prototype has a ranging module
  The navbot prototype has a signalling module (WiFi,Light,Sound)
